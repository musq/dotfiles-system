# Contributing Guidelines

<br>


## Contributors

### 1. Commits

Use [`git-commit-template`](src/etc/git/git-commit-template) for
commit messages guidelines. [More information](https://gist.github.com/adeekshith/cd4c95a064977cdc6c50)
Read about [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

#### Always

- Provide proper comments

#### Maybe

- Try not to keep more than 72 chars per line

#### Never

- Commit any sensitive information
- Commit trailing whitespaces
- Keep an empty line at the end of any file

### 2. Creating Pull Requests

- Rebase your `fix` branch on top of the `target` branch before
creating a PR
- Update [README.md](README.md) to reflect breaking changes

<br>


## Maintainers

### 1. Merging Pull Requests

- Do not use GitHub's `Merge Changes` button to merge PRs. It creates
unnecessary merge commits
- Fetch the `fix` branch locally using GitHub's `pull` refspec
- Rebase the `fix` branch on the `target` branch
- Merge `fix` branch in `target` branch

- You may use
[semantic-release bot](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
to manage releases
